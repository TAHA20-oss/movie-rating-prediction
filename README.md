Movie Rating Prediction using Machine Learning (Python Project)

This project uses Machine Learning models to predict movie ratings based on features such as genre, cast, budget, box office collections, and user reviews. The goal is to build a model that can estimate how well a movie will perform in terms of ratings, which can help production houses, streaming platforms, and audiences make informed decisions.

üîë Key Features

Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Import movie datasets (CSV/Excel/JSON).

Collect attributes like title, genre, director, actors, budget, revenue, and user ratings.

Clean data by handling missing values, duplicates, and categorical encoding (genres, cast).

Normalize numerical features (budget, revenue).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize distribution of ratings across movies.

Correlation analysis between features (e.g., budget vs. revenue, genre vs. rating).

Identify trends in top genres, directors, and actors influencing ratings.

Feature Engineering:

One-hot encoding for categorical features (genres, languages).

Extract keywords from movie descriptions using NLP (optional).

Create derived features such as ROI (Return on Investment).

Model Building:

Train regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost, etc.

Optionally classify ratings into categories (e.g., ‚ÄúLow‚Äù, ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù, ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù) using classifiers.

Split dataset into training and testing sets for evaluation.

Evaluation:

Metrics: R¬≤ Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Compare performance across multiple models.

Visualization & Insights:

Scatter plots of predicted vs. actual ratings.

Feature importance analysis (which factors impact ratings the most).

Export prediction results to CSV/Excel.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Optional: NLP libraries (NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn TF-IDF) for analyzing descriptions/reviews

üöÄ Possible Extensions

Integrate user reviews sentiment analysis to improve predictions.

Build a movie recommendation system alongside ratings prediction.

Deploy a Streamlit web app for interactive rating predictions.
